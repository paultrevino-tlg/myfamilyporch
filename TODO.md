# My Family Porch — build plan

Work top to bottom. Check items off as you go. Each phase has a **→ read** line:
open those `docs/SPEC.md` sections and prototypes before building, not the whole
spec. Each phase should leave the app building and deployable.

## Phase 0 — Project setup
→ read: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] 0.1 `npm install`; if any package fails to resolve, install latest and update package.json
- [x] 0.2 Create/link the Supabase project; set env in `.env.local` + `.dev.vars`
- [x] 0.3 Apply `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` (Supabase MCP or `npm run db:push`)
- [x] 0.4 `npm run db:types`
- [x] 0.5 `npm run seed:prompts` (bilingual global library)
- [x] 0.6 Confirm `npm run preview` runs on the Cloudflare runtime
- [x] 0.7 Connect repo to Cloudflare for auto-deploy — verified live at myfamilyporch.paul-trevino.workers.dev (build cmd `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`, deploy from `main`)
